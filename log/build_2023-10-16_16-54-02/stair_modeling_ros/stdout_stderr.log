-- looking for PCL_IN_HAND_SCANNER
[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /home/nimrod/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cmake/data/share/cmake-3.26/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args`
  (PCL_IN_HAND_SCANNER) does not match the name of the calling package (PCL).
  This can lead to problems in calling code that expects `find_package`
  result variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:619 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:37 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
